### Hello boys and girls ðŸ‘‹

From my doctorate in kinetics to computer vision algorithmics at my current position my work is in statistical physics and applications. I enjoy research in type theory, distributed computing, stochastics and topics in-between. I teach Python, I've professionally worked with C++ and MatLab and I like Idris, Haskell and Mathematica.
