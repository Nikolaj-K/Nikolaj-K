### Hello boys and girls ðŸ‘‹

From my doctorate in kinetics simulations to the computer vision algorithmics at my current position, my work's focus is in statistical physics and its applications. 
I enjoy research in type theory, distributed computing, stochastics and topics in-between. 
I teach Python, I've professionally worked with C++ and MatLab and I like Idris, Haskell and Mathematica.
